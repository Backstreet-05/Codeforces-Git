## tell me why (ain't nothin' but a heartache)
Made this repo just to keep track of all the [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/Backstreet05) questions I solve, in case I or someone else needs them again in any contests.

## Structure
I am following Striver's (or TakeUForward) CP [sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interview-experience/strivers-cp-sheet), so I'll be keeping the structure similar to that sheet.

## Contribution
I welcome contributions to improve the quality of the code in this repository. If you have suggestions for improvements or corrections to the existing code, please feel free to submit a pull request.
Please note that all pull requests will be reviewed by me before they are merged into the main repository. This is to ensure that the changes align with the objectives of the repository and maintain its quality standards (lol).
